# Character Input

*input strings types int*

## Exercise 1 (and [Solution](https://www.practicepython.org/solution/2014/02/05/01-character-input-solutions.html))

Create a program that asks the user to enter their name and their age. Print out a message addressed to them that tells them the year that they will turn 100 years old. *Note: for this exercise, the expectation is that you explicitly write out the year (and therefore be out of date the next year). If you want to do this in a generic way, see [exercise 39](https://www.practicepython.org/exercise/2022/03/20/39-character-input-datetime.html)*.

Extras:

1. Add on to the previous program by asking the user for another number and printing out that many copies of the previous message. (*Hint: [order of operations](http://www.mathsisfun.com/operation-order-pemdas.html) exists in Python*)
2. Print out that many copies of the previous message on separate lines. (*Hint: the string "\n is the same as pressing the ENTER button*)

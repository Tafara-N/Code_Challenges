## Food Ratings

In a five-star restaurant review system (❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️), the stars typically represent the different levels of satisfaction.

But what does each of the stars mean?

Start by creating a `rating` variable and set it equal to a decimal number.

Make a rating system using an `if`/`elif`/`else` statement:

- `rating` greater than 4.5, print `'Extraordinary'`
- `rating` greater than 4, print `'Excellent'`
- `rating` greater than 3, print `'Good'`
- `rating` greater than 2, print `'Fair'`
- Everything else, print `'Poor'`
